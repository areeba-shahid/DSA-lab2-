# Data Structures and Algorithms Lab 2 - Sorting Algorithms

Welcome to **Lab 2 of Data Structures and Algorithms**! In this lab, we will focus on **sorting algorithms**, which are crucial for organizing data efficiently. You will learn how to implement various sorting algorithms and analyze their performance.

## Objectives
- Understand and implement fundamental sorting algorithms.
- Compare the time complexity and performance of different sorting algorithms.
- Gain hands-on experience with algorithm optimization techniques.

## Topics Covered
1. **Bubble Sort**
2. **Selection Sort**
3. **Insertion Sort**
4. **Merge Sort**
5. **Quick Sort**

## Lab Exercises

### 1. **Bubble Sort**
- Implement the **Bubble Sort** algorithm to sort an array of integers.
- In this algorithm, adjacent elements are compared and swapped if they are in the wrong order. Repeat this process until the array is sorted.

### 2. **Selection Sort**
- Implement **Selection Sort**, which works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and swapping it with the first unsorted element.

### 3. **Insertion Sort**
- Implement **Insertion Sort**, which builds the sorted array one element at a time by picking elements and placing them in their correct position.

### 4. **Merge Sort**
- Implement **Merge Sort**, a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides the array into two halves and merges them in sorted order.

### 5. **Quick Sort**
- Implement **Quick Sort**, another divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element and partitions the array around the pivot before recursively sorting the subarrays.

### Comparison
- Compare the performance of all sorting algorithms in terms of time complexity and number of comparisons. Use a variety of input data, including sorted, reverse-sorted, and random arrays.

## Requirements
- A C++/Python/Java compiler or interpreter installed on your machine.
- Basic understanding of loops, recursion, and functions.
